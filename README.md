This repository contains serverless implementations of two stateful machine learning algorithms, k-means clustering and logistic regression. 

Intra-function parallelism has been employed in the serverless implementations to improve the performance of the machine learning algorithms.

The repository additionally contains scripts for experiments that evaluate execution times and carry out a breakdown of execution times.
